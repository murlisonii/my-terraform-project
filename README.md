Terraform

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure using declarative configuration files.

Key Features of Terraform

Infrastructure as Code: Write human-readable configuration files to define your infrastructure.
Cloud-Agnostic: Supports multiple providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and more.
Resource Dependency Management: Automatically understands dependencies and ensures resources are provisioned in the correct order.
Execution Plans: Previews changes before applying them to avoid unexpected modifications.
State Management: Keeps track of your infrastructure in a state file to manage updates effectively.
Modularity: Allows reusability through modules for consistent and scalable infrastructure.
How Terraform Works

Write: Define your infrastructure in .tf files.
Initialize: Use terraform init to set up the provider and download necessary plugins.
Plan: Run terraform plan to preview changes before applying them.
Apply: Use terraform apply to create or update resources.
Destroy: Use terraform destroy to clean up infrastructure when no longer needed.
